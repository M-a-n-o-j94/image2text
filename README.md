Problem Statement:
The goal is to develop an Image-to-Text Application that can generate descriptive text from an uploaded image, optionally incorporating user-provided prompts. This application will leverage Google's Generative AI model to interpret images and produce meaningful, human-like descriptions.

Solution:
The solution is a web-based application built using Streamlit and Google Generative AI (Gemini API). The app allows users to upload images, optionally provide a textual prompt, and receive a descriptive output generated by the Gemini model. This approach combines the flexibility of machine-generated text with user inputs to produce enhanced, context-aware descriptions.

Approach:
API Integration:
The application integrates the Google Generative AI (Gemini) model, configured with an API key. This model can generate textual content based on visual inputs (images) and optional user prompts.

Web Application:
The app is developed using Streamlit, a lightweight web framework for Python. It allows for a simple and interactive UI where users can upload image files (jpg, jpeg, png) and provide an optional text input as a prompt.

Image Processing:
Uploaded images are processed using the Pillow (PIL) library and displayed on the Streamlit interface.

Generating Descriptions:
The Generative AI model is invoked with both the image and the user-provided prompt (if available). If no prompt is provided, the model relies solely on the image to generate a descriptive text.

User Interaction:
The user uploads an image, provides an optional text input, and submits the form. The app then displays the generated description in real-time.

Output:
The output of the application is a detailed text description generated by the Gemini AI model based on the uploaded image. If a user-provided prompt is available, the description is further tailored to include contextual information derived from the prompt. The output is displayed directly on the Streamlit interface, offering users a seamless experience for interpreting images.
